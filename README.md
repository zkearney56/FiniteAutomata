Problem: 
Write a Java program that takes in a string, of any length, consisting of 0’s and 1’s. The string is to determine
	L = L1  L2 
	L1 = { x  {0,1}* | x has even length}
	L2 = { x  {0,1}* | x ends with 11 }

There should be two threads for L1 and L2.
Both L1 and L2  will get the same string and final output should be final states of  L1 and L2  and if L has been accepted.
The program should be written for the Unioner , Intersector, Difference and  Symmetric Difference.
That is call to the Unioner method with a string as a parameter will return the results for the Unioner,
and a call to the Intersector method with a string as a parameter will return the results for the Intersector and so on.
In all cases, threads and object-oriented programming methodology MUST be used.

Also includes custom List and Hashmap implementations.

This program was done entirely by me and no part of this program was plagiarized, intentionally or unintentionally, from anybody.
I would be held accountable and penalized if any part of this program was plagiarized.
